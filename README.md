Parallel Linear Algebra Subroutines
-----------------------------------------------------

An old project from 2020. written by Power Gao and myself. I mostly worked on all CUDA APIs/kernels. I inherited heavily from Sean Baxter's amazing [moderngpu](https://github.com/moderngpu/moderngpu). Kudos Sean!

I have relaunched this project in Jan 2023 to explore some interesting CUDA primitives.
